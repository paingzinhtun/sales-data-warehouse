# Performance Optimization Tips for Sales Data Warehouse

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Use Indexes
Indexes improve query performance by allowing faster search and retrieval of data. Always index foreign keys and frequently queried columns.

### Example:
```sql
-- Create index on foreign keys
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_date ON fact_sales(date_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_customer ON fact_sales(customer_id);
```

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Partitioning Large Tables
Partitioning allows large tables (like `fact_sales`) to be divided into smaller, more manageable pieces. It improves query performance for large datasets.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE fact_sales_2024 PARTITION OF fact_sales 
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-12-31');
```
- **Range Partitioning** is recommended for time-based data, such as monthly or yearly sales.
- Partitioning can make queries more efficient when filtering by date ranges.

## ðŸ”¹3. Materialized Views
Materialized views store query results as physical tables and can  be refreshed periodically. They are useful for complex aggregation queries that donâ€™t need real-time data.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW top_selling_products AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(total_sales) AS revenue
FROM fact_sales 
GROUP BY product_id;
```
- Materialized views can greatly speed up complex reports.
- Be sure to **refresh materialized views periodically** to ensure data consistency.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Query Optimization Techniques
### a. Minimize JOINs
- Avoid unnecessary joins. Only join tables when necessary.
- Filter data **early** by using `WHERE` clauses before performing joins.

### b. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command helps analyze the query execution plan and optimize slow queries.

**Example:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM fact_sales
WHERE date_id = 1;
```

### c. Avoid `SELECT *`
- Only select the columns you need for your results.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT product_name, total_sales
FROM fact_sales
WHERE date_id = 1;
```

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Optimize Aggregation Queries
For aggregation queries, consider **creating summary tables** or materialized views to pre-aggregate data, reducing computation time.

**Example: Pre-aggregate Sales Data**
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_summary AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales
FROM fact_sales
GROUP BY product_id;
```

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Vacuum and Analyze
PostgreSQL maintains statistics about the distribution of data for query optimization. Periodically run `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` to reclaim space and update statistics.

```sql
VACUUM;
ANALYZE;
```
### When to Run:
- After large data imports or updates.
- Regularly, to keep query performance optimal.

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Optimize Joins Using JOIN Type
Choosing the right type of join can improve performance. PostgreSQL supports `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

- Use `INNER JOIN` when you only need matching rows from both tables.
- Avoid `LEFT JOIN` unless necessary, as itâ€™s less efficient.

**Example:**
```sql
-- More efficient
SELECT p.product_name, s.total_sales
FROM fact_sales s
INNER JOIN dim_product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id;

-- Less efficient
SELECT p.product_name, s.total_sales
FROM fact_sales s
LEFT JOIN dim_product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id;
```

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Use Efficient Data Types
Choosing the correct data type for your columns helps optimize storage and speed. 

- **Use `integer` or `bigint`** for numeric columns instead of `varchar`.
- **Use `date` or `timestamp`** for date-related columns instead of `varchar`.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Use integer or bigint for numeric data
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (
    sales_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    total_sales bigint
);
```

## ðŸ”¹ 9. Denormalization for Performance
In some cases, **denormalizing data** (i.e., adding redundant data) in the schema can improve performance, especially for read-heavy workloads.

**Example: Store pre-calculated summary data**
```sql
CREATE TABLE product_sales_summary (
    product_id int PRIMARY KEY,
    total_sales decimal
);
```
This approach avoids recalculating totals from scratch every time a query is run.

## ðŸ”¹ 10. Batch Data Insertion
When inserting large amounts of data, **batch the inserts** into smaller transactions instead of inserting row by row. This reduces overhead and speeds up the insert process.

**Example:**
```sql
-- Insert multiple rows at once
INSERT INTO fact_sales (date_id, product_id, customer_id, total_sales)
VALUES 
(1, 101, 1001, 500),
(2, 102, 1002, 700),
(3, 103, 1003, 800);
```

## Summary
By following these optimization tips, your **data warehouse will run more efficiently**, allowing for:
- Faster query execution
- Better scalability
- Smoother user experience

Regularly apply these strategies to maintain peak performance as your data grows.
